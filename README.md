commissioner
============

A simple commission website for artists.


Requirements:
  PHP 5.3 +, PHP PDO, Apache 2.2.22 +, and MySQL 5.5.29 +

How to setup:
  1. Copy files into web root of server
  2. Run queries in sqlSetup.sql under desired DB
  3. Edit _/include/env.php variables to reflect desired database
    I.e. Change user/pass & database name and location
  4. Navigate to web root in browser
  5. Follow on-screen setup
  6. Done!


Note: I've mostly created this website for my wife, who is an artist. The site fits her requirements,
but I'm constantly looking for ways to improve the site. If you have any ideas, let me know :)
